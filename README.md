# Web Tiny Rasterizer

Port of tiny rasterizer written in TypeScript. Site uses Qwik framework.

This repo is part of a bigger project I decided not to finish. This is simply its guts, with a simple interface to go along with it.

Improvements to be considered:

- Default bunny can be rendered but because model matrix is the default one for a blender sphere, it looks small. Need to let user change up the model matrix


## Usage

```shell
bun run install
````

To start up the project:

```shell
bun run start
```
